This is  a fictitious  e-commerce website that includes 5 pages, such as: 
•	Home page: This will act as the introduction to the website content, presenting a brief outline of Electric Vehicles (EVs), their advantages, and their utilisation for the future of the transport industry. 

•	About Us page: This page will present the brand by featuring its core mission with its defined vision and fundamental values.
